# Math4Robots
===============

**Mathematical modeling of robots Toolbox.**

**Math4Robots** is a MATLAB Toolbox that implements some functions for mathematical modeling of robot manipulators. Mathematical models are a powerful tool for representing geometric and dynamic aspects of robots. That is why, the motivation behind this project, was to implement mathematical functions that could facilitate these tasks.
